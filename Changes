Revision history for PostgreSQL extension semver.

0.6.0   TBD
      - Updated extension to support SEMV 2.0.0.
      - Improved error output to mark specific bad character, where
        possible.
      - BREAKING CHANGE: `semver()` and cast constructors no longer support
        transitional format "X.Y.Zpre"; use "X.Y.Z-pre" or `to_semver()`.

0.5.0   2014-12-06T00:29:17Z
      - Fixed issue where the release file could be listed twice when
        installing, which causes an installation failure on some versions of
        PostgreSQL.
      - Fixed a typo in the README: `make installcheck` should be run *after*
        `make install`.
      - Fixed an issue where the installer would read the distribution version
        rather than the extension version. The latter is requierd to tell
        PostgreSQL the correct version number (since the distribution version
        is quite different from the extension version).
      - Added `LICENSE` file to simplify packaging, thanks to Richard Marko,
        who is packaging semver for Fedora.

0.4.0  2013-06-12T06:48:33Z
      - Updated the `Makefile` to reflect the recommended patterns from
        pgsql-hackers. Thanks to Cédric Villemain for the details.
      - Changed the Makefile to read the distribution name and version from
        META.json.
      - Fixed the Makefile to allow `PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config` to actually
        work.
      - Fixed an off-by-one bug in the parser that could add garbage
        characters to the end of certain semvers with patch versions. Thanks
        to Andrew "RhodiumToad" Gierth for pointing out the bug.
      - Add a macro to fetch a semver from C function arguments, and cast to
        `semver*` rather than `void*`. Suggested by Andrew "RhodiumToad"
        Gierth.
      - Removed unnecessary calls to `PG_FREE_IF_COPY()`. Only really needed
        for toastable values, and semvers are not toastable.

0.3.0  2012-11-20T19:04:30Z
      - Updated the parser to support an optional dash before the prerelease
        version, and the formatter to always emit a dash for the prerelease
        version. This brings it in line with the final semver 1.0.0
        specification. Thanks to Pieter van de Bruggen for making it happen.

0.2.4  2012-11-02T22:32:30Z
      - Fixed a memory allocation bug that could cause semvers to be displayed
        with missing or garbage characters. Thanks to Andrew "RhodiumToad"
        Gierth for help tracking down and fixing the issue.

0.2.3 2011-11-11T06:55:10Z
      - Fixed the `Makefile` so that the documentation file should properly be
        found and installed by `PGXS`.

0.2.2   2011-05-12T19:01:41
      - Tweaked MultiMarkdown table layout in the docuemntation so that the
        header row is always processed as a header row, rather than a `pre`
        block.
      - Simplified the `CREATE EXTENSION` support in the `Makefile`.

0.2.1 2011-04-20T20:37:05
      - Fixed the metadata file to reflect that the "pair" extension is not
        included in the semver distribution.
      - Added abstract and doc file to the `provides` section of `META.json`.
      - Removed the `NO_PGXS` stuff from `Makefile`, as the PostgreSQL core
        team does not recommend its use outside of the core contrib
        extensions.
      - Added PostgreSQL 9.1 `CREATE EXTENSION` support, including migration
        from an unpackaged install via `CREATE EXTENSION semver FROM
        unpackaged`.
      - Renamed `doc/semver.md` to `doc/semver.mdd`, so that PGXN will parse
        it as MultiMarkdown. This will allow the tables to be properly
        formatted.
      - Removed documentation that semver is implemented as a domain. It
        hasn't been since 0.2.0.
      - Removed Unicode characters `psql` output in the documentation.

0.2.0 2011-02-05T19:32:49
      - Converted to a native type implemented in C by Sam Vilain. While David
        was at lunch, no less.
      - As a consequence, `USING` is no longer required in an `ORDER BY`
        clause to get proper semver sort ordering.
      - Added casts from nuermic types.
      - Renamed `clean_semver()` to `to_semver()`.

0.1.0  2010-10-07 18:31:43
      - Initial version.
      - Implementation in pure PL/pgSQL.
      - Included in [PGXN Manager](https://github.com/theory/pgxn-manager).
      - Not otherwise released.
